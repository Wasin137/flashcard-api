    { "question": "What does a p-value represent in statistical analysis?", "answer": "The probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true." },
    { "question": "What is the difference between sensitivity and specificity in diagnostic tests?", "answer": "Sensitivity measures true positives, while specificity measures true negatives." },
    { "question": "What type of variable is blood type (A, B, AB, O) considered?", "answer": "A categorical (nominal) variable." },
    { "question": "What does an R-squared value indicate in regression analysis?", "answer": "The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s)." },
    { "question": "What is the null hypothesis in statistical testing?", "answer": "A statement that there is no effect or no difference, which researchers aim to reject." },
    { "question": "What does a Type I error mean in hypothesis testing?", "answer": "It occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true (false positive)." },
    { "question": "What is the purpose of a Kaplan-Meier curve?", "answer": "It estimates the survival function and displays survival probabilities over time." },
    { "question": "What statistical test would you use to compare means between two independent groups?", "answer": "A two-sample t-test (independent t-test)." },
    { "question": "What does 'power' refer to in the context of a statistical test?", "answer": "The probability that the test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis (1 - Type II error)." },
    { "question": "What statistical test would you use to compare means between three or more independent groups?", "answer": "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)." },
    { "question": "What is the purpose of a Chi-square test?", "answer": "To test for association between two categorical variables." },
    { "question": "What statistical test is used to compare the means of two related groups?", "answer": "A paired t-test." },
    { "question": "What is the purpose of a logistic regression?", "answer": "To model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables." },
    { "question": "What test would you use to assess the normality of data?", "answer": "The Shapiro-Wilk test." },
    { "question": "What is the purpose of a Mann-Whitney U test?", "answer": "To compare differences between two independent groups when the dependent variable is not normally distributed." },
    { "question": "What is the purpose of a Fisher's exact test?", "answer": "To test for an association between two categorical variables in small sample sizes." },
    { "question": "What is the purpose of a Wilcoxon signed-rank test?", "answer": "To compare paired data when the differences between pairs are not normally distributed." },
