# Flashcards Web App

## Description

A small, interactive web app designed to help medical students memorize complex and often tedious medical knowledge more effectively. This project aims to make learning more engaging by organizing information into quick, accessible flashcards. Each flashcard will feature concise questions and answers, allowing students to review critical concepts efficiently, whether theyâ€™re on the go or preparing for exams. The app also incorporates spaced repetition, ensuring users can retain and recall information more easily over time.

npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables to connect to your KV database:

```bash
KV_URL="redis://<your-secret>:<your-secret>@direct-koi-20121.upstash.io:6379"
KV_REST_API_URL="https://direct-koi-20121.upstash.io"
KV_REST_API_TOKEN="<your-secret>"
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN="<your-secret>"
```

### Step 4: Start the App
Run the app locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the web app should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Step 5: Navigate Through the App
